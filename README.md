**Farmer Market**

--This project aims to solve the challenge of directly and conveniently connecting local farmers with consumers in their community.


--It will achieve this by providing a user-friendly online platform where farmers can easily register and showcase their fresh produce and agricultural products, while buyers can browse these offerings, discover local goods, and make purchases directly. 


--This fosters a more direct trade relationship, supports local agriculture, and ensures consumers have better access to fresh, locally sourced food
